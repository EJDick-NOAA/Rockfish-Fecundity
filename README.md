# Rockfish-Fecundity
Rockfish (genus Sebastes) fecundity parameter values from Dick et al. (2017) with conversions for Stock Synthesis

"Table_6_from_Dick_et_al_2017_with_unit_conversions.csv" contains posterior medians of the fecundity-length relationship
F=aL^b reported by Dick et al. (2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.11.009). Values of the coefficient (a) are provided for units of
(fecundity in eggs, length in mm) as reported in the paper, as well as units of (fecundity in millions of eggs, length in cm)
for use in Stock Synthesis, version 3 (SS3).

*Note:* SS3 tracks numbers of fish in 1000s, so the reported spawning
output will be in units of billions of eggs.

Conversion from units of [eggs, mm] to [eggsx10^6, cm] was calculated as a' = (a*10^b)/1000000
